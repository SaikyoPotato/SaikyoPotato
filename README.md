## Why am I an LLM?
### Because:
1. I easily forget what was said earlier in the conversation making me look dumb
2. I do not really understand what is talked about and instead say something barely appropiate but it doesn't quite fit
3. I feel like I need to use lots of energy and resources to be able to socialize
4. I sometimes remember things that aren't that way or things that didnt happen
